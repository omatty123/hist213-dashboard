      "summary": "These documents reveal the ideology and experience of Japan's fifteen-year war in Asia (1931-1945). Official rhetoric proclaimed Japan's mission to 'liberate' Asia from Western colonialism under the banner of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Soldiers' accounts reveal both the indoctrination that made aggression seem righteous and the brutal reality of warfare against civilian populations.\n\nThe gap between rhetoric and reality is striking. Japan claimed to free Asia while exploiting it; promised prosperity while extracting resources; spoke of liberation while committing atrocities. Understanding how intelligent people came to believe these contradictions—and how some came to see through them—is essential for understanding not just Japanese history but how war propaganda works.",

      "summary": "The 'comfort women' testimonies document one of the war's worst atrocities: the systematic sexual enslavement of women by the Japanese military. Estimates suggest 50,000-200,000 women, mostly Korean but also Chinese, Filipino, Dutch, and others, were forced into military brothels. Survivors remained silent for decades; only in the 1990s did they begin speaking publicly.\n\nThese testimonies are difficult to read but essential. They document kidnapping, confinement, repeated rape, and physical abuse. They also document survival, resistance, and the courage required to speak decades later. The ongoing disputes over comfort women memorials and Japanese government apologies show how unresolved historical trauma continues to poison regional relations.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: These readings contain descriptions of sexual violence. Students should be prepared for disturbing content.",

  "overallSynthesis": "These readings bring us face-to-face with the human cost of the nationalism and imperialism we've studied abstractly. Tokutomi Sohō's Social Darwinism (Plate 17) and Fukuzawa's 'Leaving Asia' (Plate 12) provided intellectual justification for empire; these documents show what empire actually meant for its victims.\n\nThe comfort women testimonies are particularly important because they challenge both Japanese denial and the abstraction of 'historical atrocities.' These were individual women with names and lives, violated systematically by a state that claimed to be liberating Asia. Their survival and eventual testimony represent a form of resistance that outlasted the empire itself.\n\nThe ongoing disputes over comfort women—memorials erected and removed, apologies made and retracted, historical facts denied and reaffirmed—show that this history isn't 'past.' Korean anger and Japanese defensiveness continue to shape regional relations. Understanding why this issue remains so contentious requires understanding what happened, why it remained suppressed so long, and what genuine reconciliation might require.\n\nCONTENT NOTE: These are emotionally difficult readings. Students should be prepared for disturbing content and supported in processing it.",
  "executiveSummary": "Japan's fifteen-year war in Asia (1931-1945) caused immense suffering: millions dead in China, Korea colonized and exploited, Southeast Asia occupied. The 'comfort women' system—military sexual slavery—represents one of the war's most horrific aspects. These readings bring us face-to-face with both the ideology that drove Japanese aggression and the human cost of that aggression.\n\nThe comfort women testimonies are difficult to read but essential. These women, mostly Korean but also Chinese, Filipino, Dutch, and others, were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military. Their stories remained suppressed for decades; only in the 1990s did survivors begin speaking out. The ongoing disputes over comfort women memorials show how unresolved historical trauma continues to poison Japan-Korea relations.",
