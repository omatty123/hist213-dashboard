      "author": "Lu Xun (鲁迅)",

      "summary": "Lu Xun's satirical novella, serialized in the Beijing Morning Post supplement from December 1921 to February 1922, creates Ah Q: a rural day-laborer in the fictional village of Weichuang who survives every humiliation through 'spiritual victories,' mental gymnastics that transform defeats into triumphs. Beaten by stronger men? 'It is as if I were beaten by my son.' Robbed of his silver? Slap your own face until it feels like you slapped someone else.\n\nThe novella's nine chapters trace Ah Q through escalating crises: social humiliation, failed romantic pursuit, petty theft, and the arrival of the 1911 Revolution. The revolution chapters are the satirical core. Ah Q embraces revolution as a chance to become the bully: 'I shall take what I want! I shall like whom I please!' But the village elite simply cut their queues, call themselves revolutionaries, and bar Ah Q from joining. The revolution changes costumes, not structures.\n\nIn the final chapter, Ah Q is arrested for a robbery he didn't commit, tried before a court he doesn't understand, and asked to sign a confession he can't write. He tries to draw a circle instead and produces 'a shape like a melon seed.' He is executed. The crowd is disappointed because the shooting wasn't as entertaining as a decapitation.\n\nLu Xun's target was not one fictional character but China itself. Ah Q embodies what Lu Xun diagnosed as national pathologies: self-deception, bullying the weak while submitting to the strong, claiming moral victories while losing every actual battle. This self-critical nationalism differs sharply from the defensive nationalisms of Korea (Plate 18) and the expansionist nationalism of Japan (Plate 17).",

      "bio": "Born into a declining scholar-gentry family in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Grandfather imprisoned for examination fraud (1893), father died after futile traditional medicine treatments (1896). Studied medicine in Sendai, Japan (1904-1906); abandoned it after the lantern slide incident. Published 'Diary of a Madman' (1918), the first major modern Chinese story written in vernacular. 'The True Story of Ah Q' (1921-22) became his most famous work. Led the League of Left-Wing Writers (1930). Never joined the Communist Party but moved steadily leftward. Died of tuberculosis in Shanghai, October 19, 1936. Coffin draped with banner reading 'Soul of the Nation' (民族魂). Mao later canonized him as 'the commander of China's cultural revolution.'"

  "overallSynthesis": "Lu Xun's 'Ah Q' represents a distinctively Chinese form of nationalism: self-critical rather than defensive, attacking Chinese culture to save the Chinese nation. Where Korean nationalists (Plate 18) emphasized victimhood and moral superiority, Lu Xun insisted that Chinese weakness invited foreign aggression. The cure wasn't just expelling invaders but transforming Chinese culture itself.\n\nThis connects to the May Fourth Movement's radical agenda: destroy the 'old China' of Confucianism, hierarchy, and submission to create a 'new China' capable of standing among nations. Lu Xun himself was skeptical of easy solutions. He saw the 1911 revolution as farce, nationalism as potentially another form of self-deception. His critique cut deeper than politics to the level of culture and psychology.\n\nComparing the three nationalisms: Japanese nationalism (Plate 17) was expansionist and confident. Korean nationalism (Plate 18) was defensive and moral. Chinese nationalism (Plate 19) was self-critical and satirical. All three emerged from encounters with Western imperialism; all three would shape twentieth-century East Asian history; but they started from fundamentally different diagnoses of what the problem was.",
  "executiveSummary": "Lu Xun (1881-1936) is considered modern China's greatest writer. 'The True Story of Ah Q' (1921-22) is a satirical novella about a rural day-laborer who transforms every humiliation into a 'spiritual victory' through self-deception. Lu Xun's target was China itself: a culture that taught people to claim psychological triumphs while suffering actual defeats.\n\nThe novella's nine chapters move from social comedy to political satire to tragedy. Ah Q's 'spiritual victory method' is the core: beaten and humiliated, he reinterprets each loss as a win. The revolution chapters (7-8) show the 1911 Revolution arriving in a village where nothing actually changes. The final chapter's execution scene, with Ah Q failing to draw a circle as his confession, is among the most famous moments in Chinese literature.\n\nThis self-critical nationalism stands in stark contrast to the defensive Korean nationalism of Plate 18 and the expansionist Japanese nationalism of Plate 17. Lu Xun believed China's problems were internal, not just external. The cure was cultural transformation, not just expelling foreigners.",
