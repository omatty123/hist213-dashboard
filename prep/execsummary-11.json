      "summary": "The Harris Treaty established the template for Japan's 'unequal treaties' with Western powers. American consul Townsend Harris negotiated terms that mirrored China's post-Opium War concessions: extraterritoriality for American citizens, fixed tariff rates limiting Japanese revenue, and opening of additional ports. Yet the circumstances differed crucially: Japan signed without a war, through negotiation rather than defeat.\n\nThe treaty's provisions reveal both Western demands and Japanese adaptation. Harris argued that signing voluntarily would be better than waiting for Britain (fresh from victories in China) to impose harsher terms by force. Japanese negotiators extracted what concessions they could—later revision dates, limitations on where foreigners could travel. The document shows Japan entering the Western treaty system on unfavorable but not catastrophic terms.",

      "summary": "The shogunate's unprecedented consultation with daimyo on foreign policy reveals a regime in crisis—traditionally, daimyo had no voice in national matters. Their responses ranged from defiant resistance ('expel the barbarians') to pragmatic accommodation ('study Western methods to strengthen Japan') to opportunistic positioning (using the crisis to advance domain interests).\n\nThese documents show that Japan's response to the West was neither unanimous nor predetermined. The eventual Meiji transformation emerged from intense debate among competing visions. The 'sonnō jōi' (revere emperor, expel barbarians) slogan initially meant armed resistance to foreigners; only later did it transform into 'revere emperor, modernize Japan.' The daimyo opinions capture a society thinking through an existential challenge in real time.",

  "overallSynthesis": "The Harris Treaty and daimyo responses together reveal Japan at a crossroads. Unlike China, which was forced into its treaty system through military defeat, Japan entered through negotiation—but this distinction should not be overstated. Harris explicitly warned that Britain might impose worse terms by force; Japan signed from weakness, not choice.\n\nYet the daimyo debates show something China lacked: a structured political arena where alternatives could be debated. The shogunate's consultation—itself a sign of weakness—created space for competing visions. The voices urging 'learn Western techniques to resist the West' would eventually triumph, but only after the 'expel the barbarians' faction tried and failed at armed resistance.\n\nThe comparison with Qing China (Plate 10) is instructive. Both faced similar pressures; both signed similar treaties. But Japan's decentralized political system (powerful domains, marginalized shogunate) created opportunities for new coalitions that would overthrow the old order. China's more centralized system made such transformation harder. The difference wasn't cultural superiority but political structure—and the contingent choices made by specific actors in specific moments.",
  "executiveSummary": "Commodore Matthew Perry's 'Black Ships' arrived in Edo Bay in 1853, demanding that Japan end its sakoku ('closed country') policies and open to American trade. Unlike China, which had been forced open by war, Japan negotiated—first the Convention of Kanagawa (1854), then the Harris Treaty (1858). The daimyo responses reveal intense debate: some advocated resistance, others accommodation, still others saw opportunity for reform.\n\nJapan ultimately signed 'unequal treaties' similar to China's, including extraterritoriality and tariff limits. But the outcome was profoundly different: rather than a 'century of humiliation,' Japan embarked on rapid transformation. Within decades, it would renegotiate these treaties from a position of strength. Understanding why Japan's response differed from China's is one of the central puzzles of modern East Asian history—and the readings help us see that Japan's path was neither inevitable nor uncontested.",

    {
      "question": "Why did Japan avoid a war like the Opium War?",
      "basicAnswer": "Japan learned from China's example. They saw what happened when China resisted, so they negotiated instead. The US was also less aggressive than Britain.",
      "midAnswer": "Structural differences, not just 'learning.' (1) TIMING: 15 years warning — Japan watched China's humiliation. (2) DIFFERENT AGGRESSOR: US wanted coaling stations, not drug markets; less at stake, less reason to fight. (3) POLITICAL STRUCTURE: Bakufu could negotiate without undermining its own legitimacy the way Qing couldn't. (4) SCALE: Smaller polity = faster decision-making. Not Japanese wisdom vs. Chinese stubbornness — different structural conditions.",
      "advancedAnswer": "Challenge the premise. Did Japan actually 'avoid' the Opium War outcome? Japan signed unequal treaties too — extraterritoriality, tariff limits, the works. They got the SAME RESULT through different means. The real questions: (1) Could China have negotiated? Britain had specific economic interests (opium profits) that REQUIRED war; the US had no equivalent. (2) Qing tributary system ideology made Japan-style negotiation nearly impossible — the Emperor couldn't treat 'barbarians' as equals without undermining the entire cosmological order. (3) Maybe the question is Eurocentric — it assumes negotiation was always available to China when structurally it may not have been. Japan didn't avoid humiliation; they just experienced it differently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did the daimyo responses reveal about divisions within Japan?",
      "basicAnswer": "Japan was divided. Some daimyo wanted to fight ('expel the barbarians'), others wanted to negotiate and learn from the West. This debate continued until the Meiji Restoration.",
      "midAnswer": "Three positions: (1) RESISTANCE — expel the barbarians, preserve tradition. (2) ACCOMMODATION — negotiate now, learn Western techniques to resist later. (3) OPPORTUNISM — use the crisis to weaken the shogunate and advance domain interests. Key insight: Many who initially demanded resistance (Satsuma, Chōshū) later LED modernization. The positions weren't fixed.",
      "advancedAnswer": "The consultation itself was revolutionary. Bakufu asking daimyo opinions = admission of weakness. This created a political arena that hadn't existed before — suddenly alternatives could be debated publicly. China had no equivalent forum. The irony: the 'expel barbarians' faction's FAILURE at armed resistance (Shimonoseki, Kagoshima bombardments) convinced them Western technology was necessary. They didn't change their goals (strong Japan), just their methods. 'Sonnō jōi' transformed from 'expel barbarians' to 'restore emperor and modernize.' Same slogan, opposite meaning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Japan's 'opening' lead to transformation rather than humiliation?",
      "basicAnswer": "Japan adapted quickly. They adopted Western technology and institutions while preserving Japanese spirit. Strong leadership and national unity made rapid modernization possible.",
      "midAnswer": "Reject the binary. Japan DID experience humiliation — unequal treaties lasted until 1899! Better question: What enabled faster implementation? (1) No concurrent civil war (China had Taiping, 20-30M dead). (2) Domain competition drove modernization race. (3) Samurai could be redirected (stipends → bonds → investment). (4) Smaller scale = faster coordination. It's about obstacles to implementation, not willingness.",
      "advancedAnswer": "The question is ideological. It assumes 'transformation' and 'humiliation' are opposites — but Japan's transformation WAS humiliating (foreign dictation of tariffs, extraterritoriality) AND produced its own horrors (imperialism, 1945). China's 'humiliation' also produced transformation (just later, and differently). The real question: Why do we frame Japan's path as 'success'? Because it looks like Western modernization? That's measuring Asia by European standards. On a 150-year view: Japan's path → empire → catastrophic defeat → US occupation. China's path → revolution → world's 2nd largest economy. Which 'succeeded'? The framing reveals our assumptions more than the history."
