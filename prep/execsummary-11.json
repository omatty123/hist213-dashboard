      "summary": "The Harris Treaty established the template for Japan's 'unequal treaties' with Western powers. American consul Townsend Harris negotiated terms that mirrored China's post-Opium War concessions: extraterritoriality for American citizens, fixed tariff rates limiting Japanese revenue, and opening of additional ports. Yet the circumstances differed crucially: Japan signed without a war, through negotiation rather than defeat.\n\nThe treaty's provisions reveal both Western demands and Japanese adaptation. Harris argued that signing voluntarily would be better than waiting for Britain (fresh from victories in China) to impose harsher terms by force. Japanese negotiators extracted what concessions they could—later revision dates, limitations on where foreigners could travel. The document shows Japan entering the Western treaty system on unfavorable but not catastrophic terms.",

      "summary": "The shogunate's unprecedented consultation with daimyo on foreign policy reveals a regime in crisis—traditionally, daimyo had no voice in national matters. Their responses ranged from defiant resistance ('expel the barbarians') to pragmatic accommodation ('study Western methods to strengthen Japan') to opportunistic positioning (using the crisis to advance domain interests).\n\nThese documents show that Japan's response to the West was neither unanimous nor predetermined. The eventual Meiji transformation emerged from intense debate among competing visions. The 'sonnō jōi' (revere emperor, expel barbarians) slogan initially meant armed resistance to foreigners; only later did it transform into 'revere emperor, modernize Japan.' The daimyo opinions capture a society thinking through an existential challenge in real time.",

  "overallSynthesis": "The Harris Treaty and daimyo responses together reveal Japan at a crossroads. Unlike China, which was forced into its treaty system through military defeat, Japan entered through negotiation—but this distinction should not be overstated. Harris explicitly warned that Britain might impose worse terms by force; Japan signed from weakness, not choice.\n\nYet the daimyo debates show something China lacked: a structured political arena where alternatives could be debated. The shogunate's consultation—itself a sign of weakness—created space for competing visions. The voices urging 'learn Western techniques to resist the West' would eventually triumph, but only after the 'expel the barbarians' faction tried and failed at armed resistance.\n\nThe comparison with Qing China (Plate 10) is instructive. Both faced similar pressures; both signed similar treaties. But Japan's decentralized political system (powerful domains, marginalized shogunate) created opportunities for new coalitions that would overthrow the old order. China's more centralized system made such transformation harder. The difference wasn't cultural superiority but political structure—and the contingent choices made by specific actors in specific moments.",
  "executiveSummary": "Commodore Matthew Perry's 'Black Ships' arrived in Edo Bay in 1853, demanding that Japan end its sakoku ('closed country') policies and open to American trade. Unlike China, which had been forced open by war, Japan negotiated—first the Convention of Kanagawa (1854), then the Harris Treaty (1858). The daimyo responses reveal intense debate: some advocated resistance, others accommodation, still others saw opportunity for reform.\n\nJapan ultimately signed 'unequal treaties' similar to China's, including extraterritoriality and tariff limits. But the outcome was profoundly different: rather than a 'century of humiliation,' Japan embarked on rapid transformation. Within decades, it would renegotiate these treaties from a position of strength. Understanding why Japan's response differed from China's is one of the central puzzles of modern East Asian history—and the readings help us see that Japan's path was neither inevitable nor uncontested.",
