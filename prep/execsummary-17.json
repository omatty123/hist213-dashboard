      "summary": "Tokutomi Sohō's intellectual journey from 1880s liberal to 1890s imperialist encapsulates Japan's national trajectory. His early writings advocated democracy, peace, and gradual reform—influenced by British liberalism and Fukuzawa Yukichi's 'civilization' discourse. But the Triple Intervention of 1895, when Russia, France, and Germany forced Japan to return hard-won territory to China, transformed his worldview.\n\nAfter 1895, Tokutomi embraced Social Darwinism: the world was a jungle where nations either dominate or are dominated. Japan must expand or perish. His influential journalism promoted military buildup, continental expansion, and eventually the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.' He lived long enough to see Japan's empire rise and fall, remaining an unrepentant nationalist until his death in 1957.\n\nTokutomi's evolution matters because it shows how rational, educated people can come to support aggressive nationalism. The logic was coherent: if the world operates by predator/prey dynamics (as Western imperialism demonstrated), Japan must be a predator. The problem wasn't irrationality but the application of a brutal logic learned from Western powers to Asian neighbors.",

  "overallSynthesis": "Tokutomi Sohō's transformation from liberal to imperialist reveals the logic—and tragedy—of Japanese nationalism. His early idealism was genuine: democracy, education, peaceful development. But the Triple Intervention (1895) demonstrated that Western powers wouldn't treat Japan as an equal no matter how 'civilized' it became. If the international system ran on power, Japan would accumulate power.\n\nThis connects directly to Fukuzawa Yukichi's 'Leaving Asia' argument in Plate 12. Fukuzawa argued Japan should treat Asian neighbors as Westerners did; Tokutomi took this logic further, arguing Japan must build an empire as Westerners had. The path from 'civilization and enlightenment' to Asian conquest was disturbingly short.\n\nComparing Japanese nationalism (Tokutomi) with Korean nationalism (Plate 18) and Chinese nationalism (Plate 19) reveals crucial differences. Japanese nationalism was expansionist—seeking to dominate others. Korean and Chinese nationalisms were largely defensive—seeking to resist domination. This asymmetry shaped 20th-century East Asian history: Japan as aggressor, Korea and China as victims and resisters. Yet all three nationalisms shared common elements: historical grievance, claims to civilizational distinctiveness, and willingness to sacrifice individuals for the nation.",
  "executiveSummary": "Tokutomi Sohō (1863-1957) was one of Meiji Japan's most influential journalists and intellectuals. His evolution tracks Japanese nationalism's trajectory: from liberal reformer advocating democracy and peace in the 1880s, to aggressive imperialist supporting expansion by the 1890s. His writings reveal how Japanese thinkers justified empire, often using the same Social Darwinist logic that European powers used to justify their own imperialism.\n\nTokutomi argued that Japan must expand to survive in a world of competing empires. The weak would be devoured by the strong; Japan must either become a predator or become prey. This logic—learned from the West, applied to Asia—would drive Japanese imperialism through 1945. Understanding how intelligent, educated people came to support aggressive nationalism helps us recognize similar patterns elsewhere.",
