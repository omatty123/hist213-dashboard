      "summary": "These two documents bookend the first decade of Japanese colonial rule in Korea. The 'Open Letter' associated with An Jung-geun (who assassinated Japanese Resident-General Itō Hirobumi in 1909) frames resistance in terms of Asian solidarity betrayed: Japan claimed to lead Asia against Western imperialism but instead became Asia's oppressor. The 1919 Declaration of Independence, read aloud on March 1, sparked massive nationwide protests that Japan brutally suppressed.\n\nThe Declaration is remarkably sophisticated: it appeals to universal principles of self-determination (echoing Wilsonian idealism), invokes Korean historical identity, and explicitly rejects violent methods in favor of moral suasion. The authors believed international opinion would support Korea's cause—a hope that proved naive but reflected genuine faith in the emerging postwar order.\n\nThe March First Movement failed to achieve independence but succeeded spectacularly as nation-building. The protests, the suppression, the martyrs—all became foundational myths for Korean national identity. Both North and South Korea claim this heritage, though they interpret it differently.",

  "overallSynthesis": "The March First documents reveal Korean nationalism's distinctive character: moral rather than military, victim rather than aggressor, appealing to universal principles rather than narrow ethnic claims. The Declaration's tone is dignified and restrained—a remarkable achievement given the circumstances. The authors believed that justice, properly articulated, would prevail.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with Japanese nationalism (Plate 17). Where Tokutomi Sohō embraced Social Darwinist competition, Korean nationalists appealed to international law and human dignity. Where Japan sought to dominate, Korea sought recognition. These weren't just different positions but different frameworks: Japanese nationalism was about power; Korean nationalism was about justice.\n\nThe March First Movement's failure reveals the limits of moral appeal in a world of power politics. Korea's case was strong; international support was weak. The 'Wilsonian moment' proved illusory—self-determination applied to European nations, not Asian colonies. Yet the movement succeeded in creating national consciousness and founding myths that sustained resistance through decades of colonial rule and continue to shape Korean identity today.\n\nThe comparison with Chinese nationalism (Plate 19) is instructive. Both Korean and Chinese nationalisms emerged from humiliation and resistance. But Korean nationalism crystallized under direct colonial occupation, creating a sharper victim identity. Chinese nationalism developed in a semi-colonial context with more room for internal debate about how to respond.",
  "executiveSummary": "Korean nationalism crystallized under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945). The readings include two remarkable documents: an 'Open Letter' to Itō Hirobumi (Japan's Resident-General, assassinated by Korean nationalist An Jung-geun in 1909), and the 1919 Declaration of Independence. The Declaration, read aloud on March 1, 1919, sparked massive nationwide protests—the March First Movement—that Japan brutally suppressed.\n\nThese texts reveal Korean nationalism's distinctive features: appeals to civilization and justice (not just power), invocation of both Korean tradition and universal principles, and non-violent resistance strategies. The March First Movement failed to achieve independence but succeeded in demonstrating Korean national consciousness to the world. It also created martyrs and a founding myth for both North and South Korean states.",
