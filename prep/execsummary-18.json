Yi accuses Itō Hirobumi of turning Japan into 'a nation devoid of morality' while violating the Treaty of Shimonoseki which had promised to recognize Korea's 'full and complete independence and autonomy.' The letter frames Korean resistance as morally justified self-defense against a power that has 'disrupted the affairs of the royal court' and seeks 'to end the independence of another state.'",

  "overallSynthesis": "These documents trace the evolution of Korean nationalism from armed resistance (Righteous Armies) through cultural/educational nationalism (Patriotic Enlightenment) to the transformative March First Movement and its institutional expressions (Provisional Government, Declaration of War). What emerges is a distinctive nationalism: moralistic rather than militaristic, appealing to universal principles rather than ethnic supremacy, victimized rather than victimizing.\n\nThe March First Declaration is the centerpiece. Its rhetoric is remarkable: it explicitly refuses to blame Japan ('we shall not blame Japan') while asserting Korean rights. It appeals not to racial destiny but to 'the awakening conscience of mankind.' It commits to non-violence: 'Our action today... should not engender antiforeign feelings.' This is nationalism with Buddhist and Christian influences—Han Yongun the Buddhist monk and many Christian leaders were among the 33 signatories.\n\nThe Provisional Government in Shanghai institutionalized these ideals. Its constitution proclaimed democracy, equality (including gender equality), and human rights—values not traditional in Korean political thought but embraced as part of the national project. When war came in 1941, the exile government's Declaration of War aligned Korea with the Allies and the Atlantic Charter's promise of self-determination.\n\nYet these documents also reveal the tragedy. Korean nationalists believed that moral appeal and international law would prevail. They didn't. The 'Wilsonian moment' proved illusory—self-determination applied to European nations, not Asian colonies. The U.S. never recognized the exile government. Korea was 'liberated' in 1945 only to be immediately divided. The fire of nationalism, kept alive for thirty-five years, would fuel both North and South Korean states—and their competing claims to March First's legacy.",
  "executiveSummary": "Korean nationalism crystallized under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945) through several phases. Early armed resistance by Righteous Armies gave way to 'patriotic enlightenment'—building national strength through education and economic development. The March First Movement of 1919 transformed everything: the Declaration of Independence, read aloud across Korea on March 1, sparked massive nationwide protests that Japan brutally suppressed.\n\nThe readings include primary sources showing nationalism's range: Yi Kangnyŏn's fierce denunciation of Itō Hirobumi, the Patriotic Enlightenment Movement's gradualist strategy, the March First Declaration's remarkable blend of moral appeal and non-violence, the Provisional Government's democratic constitution, and the 1941 Declaration of War against Japan. Korean nationalism was distinctive: it appealed to universal principles (not ethnic destiny), embraced non-violence (not militarism), and claimed victim status (not conqueror glory). Both Koreas today trace their legitimacy to March First—though they interpret it very differently.",
