      "summary": "These documents capture Joseon Korea's internal debate about how to respond to Western pressure. The 'Defense of Orthodoxy' (wijŏng ch'ŏksa) writers made sophisticated arguments for maintaining Confucian traditions: Western technology divorced from Confucian morality would be dangerous; Christianity undermined the social order; hasty reform would cause more harm than foreign threats.\n\nThe reformist voices argued for selective adoption: take Western technology while preserving Korean essence. This 'Eastern ethics, Western techniques' formula paralleled Chinese self-strengthening rhetoric but emerged from Korean conditions—particularly the Sirhak tradition of practical learning examined in Plate 7.\n\nCrucially, both camps were responding to real threats. Conservative fears about Christianity weren't paranoid—thousands of Korean Catholics had been executed as subversives. Reformist urgency wasn't naive—Japan and Western powers were clearly moving toward forced opening. The debate wasn't simply reactionary vs. progressive but different risk assessments about which threats to prioritize.",

  "overallSynthesis": "The Defense of Orthodoxy debates reveal that Korea wasn't simply a 'hermit kingdom' refusing contact with the outside world. Korean intellectuals were actively debating modernization—but on different terms than Japan or China. The conservatives who resisted Western influence had genuine arguments: Christianity did challenge Confucian family ethics; technology without moral framework could be dangerous; hasty reform could destroy social stability without creating new foundations.\n\nThis matters for understanding Korea's different trajectory from Japan. Meiji Japan achieved consensus around rapid Westernization; Joseon Korea remained divided between reform and orthodoxy factions, with neither able to dominate. When Japan forced Korea open (1876) and eventually annexed it (1910), Koreans hadn't resolved their internal debates—they were still arguing about how to respond to modernity when modernity was imposed from outside.\n\nThe comparison with Plate 7 (Sirhak reform) and Plate 14 (Tonghak Rebellion) is instructive. Korea had indigenous reform traditions and revolutionary alternatives, but neither succeeded in transforming the state. The Defense of Orthodoxy faction blocked elite reforms; the Qing and Japanese interventions crushed popular uprisings. Korea's 'slow evolution' wasn't lack of ideas but lack of opportunity to implement them.",
  "executiveSummary": "As China and Japan faced Western pressure and internal crisis, Joseon Korea pursued a cautious path: maintaining Confucian orthodoxy while selectively engaging with new ideas. The readings reveal debates between reformers who saw need for change and conservatives who defended traditional learning as sufficient. These were not simply 'progressive' vs. 'reactionary' positions—conservatives had genuine concerns about social disruption, while reformers often disagreed about what to adopt.\n\nThe 'Defense of Orthodoxy' writings show sophisticated arguments for why Western technology without Confucian morality would be dangerous. They also reveal anxieties about Christianity and foreign economic penetration. Understanding these internal debates helps us avoid simplistic narratives of 'hermit kingdom' refusing all change. Koreans were actively debating modernization—but on different terms than Japan or China.",
