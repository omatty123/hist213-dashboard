      "summary": "He Zhen was one of early 20th-century China's most radical voices—an anarchist-feminist who argued that women's liberation required destroying not just capitalism but the entire family system. Writing from Tokyo exile around 1907, she attacked reformers who wanted to 'improve' women's conditions without fundamentally transforming society. Half-measures, she argued, would only create new forms of exploitation.\n\nHer analysis linked gender, class, and national oppression: Chinese women were enslaved by fathers, husbands, and employers; China itself was enslaved by foreign powers; both oppressions stemmed from the same system of hierarchy and exploitation. Liberation required revolution on all fronts simultaneously.\n\nHe Zhen's radicalism went beyond what even the Communist Party would later embrace. She criticized state socialism as another form of domination; true liberation required abolishing all authority. Her vision wasn't realized, but her questions—how do gender, class, and nation intersect?—continued to shape Chinese revolutionary thought.",

  "overallSynthesis": "He Zhen's writings reveal the radical vision that animated Chinese revolutionary movements—and the compromises those movements would later make. Her anarchist feminism connected all forms of oppression: gender, class, nation. True liberation required destroying the family, the state, and capitalism simultaneously. Anything less was reformism.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party would adopt some of her rhetoric while abandoning her anarchism. Land reform, women's rights, and anti-imperialism became revolutionary slogans. But the CCP built a powerful state rather than abolishing state power; reformed the family rather than destroying it; and created new hierarchies while claiming to abolish hierarchy. He Zhen's questions about whether state socialism could deliver genuine liberation remain relevant.\n\nThis reading connects to the course's broader themes. The Taiping Rebellion (Plate 13) showed radical alternatives to Confucian order; He Zhen offered another. Both were suppressed or marginalized, but both revealed that China's revolutionary tradition included visions far more radical than what actually triumphed. Understanding what was imagined—and what was foreclosed—helps us see that history wasn't inevitable.",
  "executiveSummary": "The Chinese Communist revolution was not just about class struggle—it was also about gender revolution. He Zhen (c. 1884-c. 1920) was a radical anarchist-feminist who argued that women's liberation required destroying both capitalism and the family system. Her writings reveal how Chinese revolutionaries connected economic, political, and gender oppression into a comprehensive critique of traditional society.\n\nThe broader context is China's descent into civil war between Nationalists (Guomindang) and Communists (1927-1949), interrupted by Japanese invasion (1937-1945). Both parties claimed to represent Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary legacy; both promised to cure China's weakness. The Communists ultimately won not just through military victory but by mobilizing peasants—and women—with promises of land reform and social transformation.",
