  "executiveSummary": "This discussion day bridges our historical study with contemporary East Asia. Students will brainstorm presentation topics while we examine current events through the lens of historical patterns we've studied in Plates 1-8.\n\nThe past week has provided remarkable material: South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's state visit to Beijing (Jan 4-7)—the first by a Korean president since 2019—demonstrates how Seoul navigates between great powers. Meanwhile, Japan-China relations have plunged into crisis over PM Takaichi's Taiwan statements, with Beijing imposing export controls on rare earths and dual-use goods. North Korea fired ballistic missiles hours before Lee arrived in Beijing, and experts warn Taiwan Strait tensions are at their highest point in decades.\n\nThese events directly connect to our course themes: tributary relationships and their modern echoes, the persistence of the 'Korea question,' Japan's evolving security identity, and Taiwan's contested status rooted in 19th-century Qing collapse.",

  "overallSynthesis": "Today's headlines are tomorrow's history. The events of January 2026 demonstrate that the historical dynamics we've studied in Plates 1-8 remain active forces shaping East Asia.\n\nKorea's position between China and Japan echoes the late Joseon dilemma—how does a middle power maintain sovereignty when surrounded by larger neighbors making incompatible demands? President Lee's careful diplomacy (visiting Beijing while maintaining the US alliance, visiting the colonial-era Provisional Government site while signing business deals) shows how historical memory shapes contemporary statecraft.\n\nJapan's security transformation under Takaichi represents the most significant shift since 1945. Her Taiwan statement and China's furious response reveal how the 'postwar' order is ending. Japan is becoming a 'normal' military power—a process we can only understand through the lens of Meiji transformation and postwar pacifism.\n\nTaiwan's status as potential flashpoint connects directly to the unfinished business of the Qing collapse and Chinese Civil War. And North Korea's provocations remind us that the Korean War never officially ended—it's the longest-running 'frozen conflict' in the modern world.",
