      "summary": "Lin Zexu's 1839 letter to Queen Victoria is a masterpiece of moral argumentation wrapped in the rhetoric of the Chinese world order. As Imperial Commissioner sent to Canton to suppress the opium trade, Lin appeals to universal principles of justice and reciprocity: 'We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity—this is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.' He argues that Britain, having benefited enormously from trade with China for 200 years, should not repay this generosity with poison. The letter reveals both Qing confidence ('Our celestial empire rules over ten thousand kingdoms!') and genuine bewilderment that a nation claiming to be civilized would traffic in drugs.",

      "summary": "The Treaty of Nanjing (August 29, 1842) ended the First Opium War and became the template for all subsequent 'unequal treaties' imposed on China. Its 13 articles forced China to: (1) cede Hong Kong 'in perpetuity,' (2) open five 'treaty ports' to British residence and trade, (3) pay $21 million in indemnities—including $6 million compensation for the opium Lin Zexu had destroyed, (4) abolish the Canton trade monopoly (Co-hong), and (5) establish extraterritoriality (British subjects tried only in British consular courts). Crucially, the treaty never legalized opium—Britain achieved all its goals while maintaining the fiction that the war was about 'free trade,' not narcotics.",

  "overallSynthesis": "These two documents form a devastating pair: Lin Zexu's eloquent moral appeal followed by the brutal legal machinery of imposed defeat. Read together, they explode any simple narrative of East-West encounter.\n\nLin's letter shows that Qing China was neither isolated nor incapable of sophisticated diplomacy. His arguments—reciprocity, universal ethics, mutual benefit—are exactly what we'd expect from a rational actor in international relations. He even anticipates counterarguments, noting that Britain's own laws prove opium's danger. This wasn't a 'backward' empire failing to understand the modern world; it was a principled stance that happened to lack the military power to enforce it.\n\nThe Treaty of Nanjing reveals how 'free trade' ideology served imperial interests. Notice what the treaty doesn't contain: any mention of opium. Britain achieved all its commercial and territorial goals while pretending the war was about trade restrictions and diplomatic insults, not drug trafficking. The legalistic language—'peace and friendship,' 'full security and protection'—masks what is essentially a protection racket: pay us, open your markets, cede territory, or we'll burn more cities.\n\nFor the course narrative, these readings mark the moment when the East Asian world order definitively cracked. Qianlong could dismiss Macartney in 1793 because Qing power was real; fifty years later, that power proved hollow against British naval technology. The question isn't whether this was morally wrong (it clearly was) but what combination of factors—economic, technological, institutional—had shifted the balance so dramatically.",
  "executiveSummary": "Plate 10 examines the First Opium War (1839-1842) through two primary sources that expose the moral asymmetry of Western imperialism. Lin Zexu's letter to Queen Victoria makes a compelling case against the opium trade using universal principles: if Britain bans opium at home, how can it sell poison abroad? 'Let us suppose that foreigners came from another country, and brought opium into England... would not you, the sovereign of the said country, look upon such a procedure with anger?'\n\nThe letter never reached Victoria. Instead, Britain sent gunboats, and the resulting Treaty of Nanjing forced China to cede Hong Kong, open five treaty ports, pay $21 million (including compensation for destroyed opium!), and submit to extraterritoriality. The treaty's neutral legal language conceals its nature as an imposed settlement—China paying for the privilege of being invaded.\n\nThese readings begin China's 'century of humiliation' and establish patterns that would define East Asian history: unequal treaties, treaty ports, foreign enclaves, and the burning question of how to respond to Western power.",
