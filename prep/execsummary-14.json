      "summary": "Three foundational Tonghak texts reveal the religious ideology that inspired Korea's greatest peasant uprising. Ch'oe Cheu's 'On Spreading Virtue' (1861) describes his mystical revelation and founding of Eastern Learning as a response to the Western threat. 'On Learning Truth' (1861) elaborates Tonghak theology, positioning it as distinct from yet comparable to Christianity. Ch'oe Sihyong's 'On Practicing Truth at Home' (1888) provides practical moral guidance for common believers. Together these texts show how Tonghak combined Confucian ethics, Buddhist cosmology, Daoist naturalism, and indigenous Korean shamanism into a syncretic religion with revolutionary social implications.",

  "overallSynthesis": "The Tonghak Rebellion represents Korea's 'Taiping moment' - a religious-peasant uprising that challenged the existing order and triggered catastrophic international consequences. The primary sources from Ch'oe Cheu and Ch'oe Sihyong reveal Tonghak as a sophisticated syncretic religion responding to the crisis of the 1860s: Western imperialism, Qing weakness, and domestic corruption. Ch'oe Cheu's claim that 'my mind is your mind' and 'human beings are heaven' provided theological justification for social equality that resonated with peasants suffering under yangban oppression and corrupt officials.\n\nUnlike Hong Xiuquan's Christianity-derived Taiping ideology, Tonghak explicitly positioned itself as 'Eastern Learning' - an indigenous Korean response to the Western threat. This nationalist dimension would prove crucial for Tonghak's long-term legacy, even as the 1894 uprising itself was crushed.\n\nThe secondary source reveals the tragic dynamics of 1894: local grievances against corrupt officials escalated into regional uprising; the weak Joseon government, unable to suppress the rebellion, requested Chinese assistance; Japan, determined not to let China dominate Korea, sent its own troops. The rebellion was suppressed, but Japanese and Chinese forces remained - leading directly to the First Sino-Japanese War. Japan's victory ended the tributary relationship between Korea and China that had structured East Asian international relations for centuries.\n\nThe Tonghak Rebellion thus illustrates a recurring pattern in modern East Asian history: domestic crisis invites foreign intervention, which transforms local conflicts into international wars with consequences far beyond what any participant intended. The peasants who rose up in Gobu to protest an unjust reservoir tax could not have imagined they were triggering a war that would make Japan an imperial power and set Korea on the path to colonization.",
  "executiveSummary": "The Tonghak Rebellion (1894) was Korea's Taiping moment - a religious-peasant uprising that inadvertently triggered the First Sino-Japanese War and ended Chinese influence in Korea. Tonghak ('Eastern Learning') was a syncretic religion founded by Ch'oe Cheu in 1860, combining Confucian ethics, Buddhist-Daoist cosmology, and indigenous Korean traditions into a faith that proclaimed 'human beings are heaven' and all people are equal. This message resonated with peasants suffering under corrupt officials and foreign economic penetration.\n\nWhen Tonghak-led peasants rose in Jeolla Province in 1894, the weak Joseon government requested Chinese military help. Japan, viewing Korea as vital to its security, also sent troops. Though the rebellion was suppressed, neither foreign army withdrew - and war erupted. Japan's decisive victory (1894-95) ended the Sino-Korean tributary relationship, revealed Qing military weakness, and established Japan as the dominant power in Korea. The Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) forced China to recognize Korean 'independence' - meaning independence from China, not from Japan.\n\nThe Tonghak movement survived its military defeat. Renamed Cheondogyo ('Religion of the Heavenly Way') in 1905, it remains active in both Koreas today. Both North and South Korea claim the Tonghak heritage - the North emphasizing its anti-feudal peasant revolution, the South its proto-democratic nationalism.",

    "fromPrevious": "Plate 13 examined China's Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) - a massive religious-peasant uprising that nearly overthrew the Qing dynasty. The Tonghak Rebellion invites direct comparison: both were led by charismatic founders who claimed divine revelation, both mobilized peasants with promises of social reform, both faced brutal suppression. Key differences: Taiping was influenced by Christianity while Tonghak explicitly rejected Western Learning; Taiping was larger and came closer to success; but Tonghak's international consequences were more dramatic. The suppression of Taiping relied on Western-trained forces and created regional strongmen; Tonghak suppression required foreign intervention that triggered war. Ask students: Why did a smaller rebellion in Korea have larger international consequences than the massive Taiping uprising?",
    "toNext": "Plate 15 (Joseon's Slow Evolution) examines Korea's attempts at reform in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese War. The Gabo Reforms (1894-1896) implemented many changes the Tonghak rebels had demanded - abolition of slavery, end of status discrimination, modernization of government - but under Japanese pressure rather than Korean initiative. Students should consider: Did Tonghak 'fail' if many of its reform demands were eventually enacted? What's the difference between reform achieved through rebellion vs. reform imposed by foreign power?",
    "broaderThemes": "The Tonghak Rebellion exemplifies several course themes: (1) How domestic crisis invites foreign intervention that transforms local conflicts into international wars; (2) The emergence of indigenous responses to Western imperialism that draw on traditional resources while creating something new; (3) The tension between reform and revolution - Tonghak leaders signed the Jeonju Peace Agreement hoping for reform, but foreign intervention foreclosed that possibility; (4) Korea's tragic position as battleground for larger powers - 'shrimp among whales'; (5) How historical memory serves present politics - both Koreas claim Tonghak for radically different purposes."
